# The Starlang programming language
Starlang is a small, fast and lightweight programming language that allows the C/C++ control and the JAVA ergonomy. Starlang conpiles into C code, but this process is automatized by the Starlang compiler, wich outputs an executable file (*.exe*, *.app*, *.out*...).

### Getting Starlang
If you want to get the Starlang compiler and API, you have 2 options, get the binaries in the releases page or build it from the source code, but in both cases you need to have the GCC compiler installed.

#### Binary releases
First, go to the [releases page](https://github.com/HdbSoft/Starlang/releases) and go to the latest version release, then get the *.zip* file and uncompress it, place the compiler files in the **/bin** folder if you are on macOS or LINUX, or in **C:\WINDOWS** if you are on Windows. Then place the API files in the **$HOME/Starlang** folder and you will have done. Finally, run this command:
```bash
$ starlang -h
```
and it should output some text.

#### Building it from source
If you want to build Starlang from source, you have to get the first thing you need to do is to clone the source code:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/HdbSoft/Starlang.git starlang
$ cd starlang
```
and then use make to build and install it:
```bash
$ make && make install
```

### The Starlang API
The Starlang API contains some features which could be used in your program. Here you have the modules list:
- **stdlib.sth:** I/O and other functions
- **bintree.sth:** Binary trees library
- **colors.sth:** Console colors library
- **dll.sth:** Dll management library
- **embedded.sth:** Embedded programming library
- **keyboard.sth:** Keyboard detection library
- **maths.sth:** Maths constants and functions
- **rng.sth:** Random number generation library

You can import them by using the `@import` macro:
```c
@import stdlib.sth
@import bintree.sth
@import colors.sth
@import dll.sth
@import embedded.sth
@import keyboard.sth
@import maths.sth
@import rng.sth
```

### Examples
In this paragraph you can see some Starlang examples:

#### Hello, World!
```c
@import stdlib.sth

main {
	WriteStringln("Hello, World!");
	out 0;
}
```

#### Random number generation
```c
@import stdlib.sth
@import rng.st

main {
	int n = randnum();

	WriteIntln(n);
	out 0;
}
```

#### Binary tree
```c
@import stdlib.sth
@import bintree.st

main {
	node* root = new_node(1);

	root->left  = new_node(0);
	root->right = new_node(2);

	WriteIntln(root->data);
	WriteIntln(root->left->data);
	WriteIntln(root->right->data);

	out 0;
}
```

#### Console colors
```c
@import stdlib.sth
@import colors.st

main {
	FORE_COLOR_GREEN;

	WriteStringln("Hello, World!");
	out 0;
}
```
